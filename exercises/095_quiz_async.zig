//
// Quiz Time — Async I/O!
//
// Doctor Zoraptera's insect simulation is going well, but she
// realized that her virtual garden needs weather data! Insects
// behave differently depending on temperature, humidity, and
// wind conditions.
//
// She has set up three weather sensors around the garden that
// measure conditions in parallel and report their readings
// through a shared data channel. A collector task gathers the
// readings, and after all sensors have reported, a garden
// report is printed.
//
// But Doctor Z rushed through the code (she was being chased
// by a grasshopper) and left several bugs. Can you fix them?
//
// Here's what the program should do:
//   1. Three sensor tasks send exactly 3 readings each through
//      a Queue
//   2. A collector task receives readings concurrently,
//      protected by a Mutex
//   3. After all sensors finish, the queue is closed
//   4. The final report is written in a cancel-protected section
//

// Further reading for the curious:
//
// This quiz covered the main async I/O primitives:
//   io.async()              - launch a task (may run inline)
//   io.concurrent()         - guaranteed unit of concurrency
//   Future.await/cancel     - collect or cancel a single task
//   Group.async/await/cancel - manage fire-and-forget tasks
//   Select.async/await      - race tasks, act on first completion
//   Queue                   - bounded channel between tasks
//   Mutex                   - protect shared state
//   CancelProtection        - shield critical sections
//
// There are more synchronization primitives we didn't cover:
//   Condition  - wait for a condition to become true
//   RwLock     - multiple readers OR one writer
//   Semaphore  - limit concurrent access to a resource
//   Futex      - low-level wait/wake on a memory address
//   Batch      - submit multiple I/O operations at once
//
// The key insight: all of these work through the Io VTable,
// so your code is portable across backends — whether Threaded
// (OS thread pool), or Evented (M:N green threads / fibers
// that can provide concurrency even on a single OS thread).
//
// Doctor Zoraptera approves.
